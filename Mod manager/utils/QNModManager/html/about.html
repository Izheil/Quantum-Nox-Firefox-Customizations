	<hr>
	<p>This mod manager was created to manage the updates of mods for Firefox, so that you wouldn't have to use manually install each mod.</p>
	<p>Right now it strips the header out of the mod and only loads the code after applying the var changes inside the header (similar to stylus variables),
		but it might be required to change that behaviour to make it compatible with setting the url that the mod should be applied to.
	</p>
	<p>Functions such as changing the <code>about:config</code> options or changing userChrome and userContent did not manage to get into this version, so 
		you'll still need to manage those manually.</p>
