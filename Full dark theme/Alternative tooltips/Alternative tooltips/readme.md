# Alternative tooltip designs
You can find alternative tooltip designs here. You should only use 1 at a time, and each time you change the style,
you'll have to clear the "startupcache" folder on the local folder inside `about:profiles`.

### tooltips-compact.as.css
This file will make the tooltips look the same as the default tooltips file of this theme, except with less padding, 
which makes them have more compact.

### tooltips-gray.as.css
This design will make the tooltips background color grayish.

### tooltips-dark.as.css
This design will make the tooltips background color almost black with a gray border.

### tooltips-translucid.as.css
This file will make the tooltips background be semi-transparent (at 80% opacity), so you can see through the tooltips a 
bit.

### Other variants
As you can probably tell, any of the other ones not commented here is just a combination of the ones above.
